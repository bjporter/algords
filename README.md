# Algorithms and Data Structures

    Data Structures:
        1) Linear Singly Linked List (non-recursive)
        2) Linear Singly Linked List with a Tail (non-recursive)
        3) Circular Singly Linked List (non-recursive)
        4) Doubly Linked List (non-recursive)
        5) Binary Search Tree (recursive, no duplicates)
        6) Skip Lists (non-recursive) (Implementation: Pugh, 1989)
    
    Algorithms:
        Sorting: 
            - Bogo Sort (randomly shuffle list, check if it's in order, repeat)
            - Bozo Sort (randomly swap two values, check if list is in order, repeat)
            - Insertion Sort
            - Bubble Sort 
            - Stooge Sort
